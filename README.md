### Hi there or *Moin* as we like to say in Hamburg! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying computer science (M.Sc) at the UniversitÃ¤t Hamburg, Germany.
Shortly after starting my Bachelor degree, I joined the awesome local RoboCup team [@bit-bots](https://github.com/bit-bots).
This is where I am learning lots about humanoid robotics and other interesting stuff.
